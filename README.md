# fileserver_rust

Network I/O plays a vital role in supporting server software. A file server particularly handles files where clients send/receive files from/to remote servers. Authentication of clients to the server is also critical. 

In this project, we will build a file server application that 
1) Authenticate clients using private/public key
2) Deliver/receive files
3) Write to remote files
4) Search text in remote files.
